# Ecuadot Game

Ecuadot is a simple two-player game that is played on a square grid. The objective of the game is to be the last player to place a dot on the grid such that no two dots are equidistant from any other two dots on the grid.

Each player takes turns placing a dot on an empty square of the grid. The first player to place a dot is designated as "Player 1" and their dots are colored red. The second player to place a dot is designated as "Player 2" and their dots are colored blue. The game continues until a player places a dot such that two or more pairs of dots are equidistant from each other. When this occurs, the player who placed the most recent dot loses the game.
